# GUI Tic-Tac-Toe

This program, made up of Main.java and TicTacToeFrame.java, implements a GUI-based tic-tac-toe game. The program opens a java frame to host the game board. Players, X and O, take turns making moves by clicking on empty squares. If the square is available, it will be filled with the mark of the current player. After each successful move, the program will check if the game is over or has been tied. If the game is won or tied, a button for starting a new game will become available.
